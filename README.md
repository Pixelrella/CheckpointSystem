# CheckpointSystem

A system to make a player's progress persistent. It uses the power of Unity events to let Game designers manipulate which objects are visible at what point of the player's progress. Can be used for anything that can interact with Unity events (UI, 2D, 3D). Great for creating tutorials, for example.

I created this system including tooling for game designers at the Outsiders.

In this [article](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/building-a-save-system-for-level-objects-in-unity-pt1-checkpoints-r5048/) I explain how this system works.
